# Incident Response Labs and Scripts
This repository is a collection of labs and scripts to assit in learning incident response. You will need to follow the instructions below to utilize the labs. Some of the labs require more configurations but these steps should capture the base configurations. 

## Python and Jupyter
For these labs we will be using Jupyter notebooks which allow us to interactively program and show the results as we step through the examples in the Labs. First you will need to install Anacondas Python. You can get Anaconds here:

Make sure to install Python 2.7. We wil need Python 2.7 for labs further along in this class that use Volatility which required this version. Jupyter and several other analysis tools will be installed with this python distribution. Make sure to test your Jupyter installation before moving to the next set. 

## PowerShell
The next set of tools you will need to install is a Jupyter Kernel for PowerShell. You can get this kernel and installation instructions here:
